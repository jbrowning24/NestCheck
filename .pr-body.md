# PR: Add timeouts to Google Maps and Overpass API requests

**Title:** `fix: Add timeouts to Google Maps and Overpass API requests`

**Branch:** `claude/mobile-testing-url-mB3i4` (pushed to `origin`)

---

## Summary

Adds a 25s timeout to all Google Maps and Overpass API HTTP requests so evaluations fail fast and predictably instead of hanging or depending on external timeouts.

## Changes

- **`property_evaluator.py`**
  - Introduced `API_REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 25` (seconds) and use it on every external API call.
  - **GoogleMapsClient:** `geocode`, `places_nearby`, `place_details`, `walking_time`, `driving_time`, `transit_time`, `text_search` now pass `timeout=API_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`.
  - **OverpassClient:** `get_nearby_roads` `session.post` now uses the same timeout.
  - Comment added: repeated timeouts may be quota-related (e.g. Google Maps API limits).

- **README.md**
  - Note that API requests use a 25s timeout and that repeated timeouts can indicate network or quota/rate limit issues (Cloud Console).

- **`issues/`**
  - `google-maps-geocode-timeout.md` — original issue and Linear link.
  - `google-maps-geocode-timeout-PLAN.md` — implementation plan and status.

## Why

Geocode (and other Maps) calls were using `session.get()` with no timeout, so slow or unresponsive APIs could hang indefinitely. Callers already wrap these in `try/except` and degrade gracefully; with timeouts they now get a clear failure and can continue the evaluation instead of stalling.
