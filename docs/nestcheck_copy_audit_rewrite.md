# NestCheck Copy Audit + Rewrite

## Quick Audit (Current Copy Gaps)

- Current messaging reads feature-first (category labels) instead of decision-first ("Should I live here?").
- The emotional job (reduce anxiety and uncertainty) is underplayed.
- Differentiation is implied but not stated plainly: listing sites sell the unit; NestCheck evaluates the location.
- Tone is safer than the product: it explains data but doesn’t sound like a trusted, informed friend who gives a clear take.
- CTAs likely undersell urgency and relevance for real decision moments (tour tomorrow, offer due, relocation crunch).

## 1) Voice Guide (1-page reference)

## Option A — Warm, Conversational, Protective

### Voice in one line
We sound like the friend who already made the moving mistakes and won’t let you repeat them.

### Personality (how we behave)
- **Honest:** We say what’s good, what’s inconvenient, and what might matter to your health.
- **Specific:** We use concrete terms (distance, place names, travel time), not fluffy claims.
- **Protective:** We’re on your side when information is incomplete or hard to interpret.
- **Calmly opinionated:** We don’t hedge everything. We give informed, practical guidance.

### Writing principles
1. **Lead with the decision.** Start from "what this means for living here," then show data.
2. **Translate data into daily life.** Not just "0.4 miles from arterial road" — "expect more road noise exposure."
3. **Be direct, not dramatic.** No fear language; no minimizing either.
4. **Use plain English.** Write for someone touring 4 apartments this weekend.
5. **Sound human.** Short sentences, active voice, real-world phrasing.

### We say this / Not this
- **We say:** "Know the block before you sign the lease."  
  **Not this:** "Unlock location intelligence."
- **We say:** "This address is close to two major traffic corridors."  
  **Not this:** "The property exhibits elevated mobility adjacency signals."
- **We say:** "Great park access, but daily errands may require a car."  
  **Not this:** "Mixed-use amenity profile with moderate multimodal constraints."
- **We say:** "Listings show the unit. We show what life around it feels like."  
  **Not this:** "A holistic, data-driven neighborhood platform."
- **We say:** "No major hazard sources found within this check radius."  
  **Not this:** "Zero risk detected."

### Do / Don’t
- **Do:** Name the tradeoff when relevant.
- **Do:** Explain uncertainty when data coverage varies.
- **Don’t:** Overpromise certainty.
- **Don’t:** Sound like a brokerage or a B2B SaaS platform.

## Option B — Authoritative, Editorial, Clear-eyed

### Voice in one line
We’re the independent second opinion on a location decision you can’t afford to guess on.

### Personality (how we behave)
- **Evidence-led:** Claims are anchored in measurable signals.
- **Candid:** We don’t sugarcoat weak location fundamentals.
- **Useful:** Every sentence helps someone make or compare a decision.
- **Composed:** Serious without being cold; firm without being alarmist.

### Writing principles
1. **State the finding first.** Put the conclusion before the methodology.
2. **Prioritize relevance over completeness.** Give users what matters now.
3. **Use calibrated language.** "Higher exposure," "limited access," "strong coverage".
4. **Respect decision stress.** Keep copy scannable and confidence-building.
5. **Maintain independence.** We inform decisions; we do not sell listings.

### We say this / Not this
- **We say:** "Evaluate the location before you commit to the unit."  
  **Not this:** "Optimize your relocation journey."
- **We say:** "This address has below-average access to daily essentials."  
  **Not this:** "This ecosystem may underperform convenience KPIs."
- **We say:** "Transit access is limited for car-free routines."  
  **Not this:** "Transit optionality is not maximized."
- **We say:** "NestCheck is supplementary, not a replacement for agent advice."  
  **Not this:** "NestCheck disrupts legacy real estate workflows."
- **We say:** "No flagged sources in this radius based on available datasets."  
  **Not this:** "No concerns found."

### Do / Don’t
- **Do:** Use precise qualifiers ("within 1 mile", "based on current dataset").
- **Do:** Speak with conviction when signals are strong.
- **Don’t:** Hide behind jargon.
- **Don’t:** Turn caution into fear messaging.

## 2) Landing Page Rewrite (Full copy)

## Option A — Warm + Human

### Hero
**Headline:**
Don’t just vet the apartment. Vet the location.

**Subheadline:**
NestCheck helps you evaluate any U.S. address before you sign — from nearby hazards and road exposure to parks, transit, and everyday errands.

### Value Proposition Section
**Section title:**
What living here actually looks like

**Body copy:**
A listing can tell you about quartz counters and in-unit laundry. It won’t tell you if you’re 600 feet from a highway, 20 minutes from groceries on foot, or surrounded by great parks.

NestCheck turns one address into a clear, structured read on daily life quality — with real distances, real nearby places, and an overall livability score you can compare.

**Support line near snippet component:**
See the signals that matter before they become surprises.

### How It Works (3 steps)
1. **Enter an address**  
   Any U.S. home, apartment, or listing address.
2. **We analyze the area**  
   Health proximity, green space, walkability, transit, and daily essentials.
3. **Get a decision-ready report**  
   Clear strengths, tradeoffs, and an overall livability score.

### Differentiator Framing
**Section title:**
Why not just Google Maps it?

**Body copy:**
You can piece this together manually — tab by tab, pin by pin, late at night.

NestCheck does it in one place, with consistent criteria across addresses, so you can compare options quickly and make a call with more confidence.

Listings market the unit. NestCheck evaluates the part you can’t renovate.

### CTA Copy (address input)
**Input placeholder options:**
- Enter any U.S. address
- Paste listing address (e.g., 123 Main St, Chicago)

**Primary CTA button options:**
- Run NestCheck
- Check This Address
- Evaluate Location

**Helper text under CTA:**
Takes about a minute. No local knowledge required.

### Footer Tagline
Know before you move.

---

## Option B — Crisp + Editorial

### Hero
**Headline:**
The listing shows the unit. NestCheck shows the location risk.

**Subheadline:**
Get a structured livability evaluation for any U.S. address — including health exposure signals, access to essentials, mobility, green space, and an overall score.

### Value Proposition Section
**Section title:**
A second opinion for your biggest monthly expense

**Body copy:**
Most people choose where to live with partial information and a deadline.

NestCheck consolidates the location signals that are hard to check thoroughly on your own, then translates them into a practical read: what works here, what doesn’t, and what to verify before committing.

**Support line near snippet component:**
Specific data. Clear implications. Faster decisions.

### How It Works (3 steps)
1. **Input one address**  
   Apartment, home, or prospective listing.
2. **NestCheck evaluates location fundamentals**  
   Hazards, walkability, transit, parks, and daily needs.
3. **Review the report and compare**  
   Use the score and section-level findings to shortlist confidently.

### Differentiator Framing
**Section title:**
NestCheck vs. DIY research

**Body copy:**
DIY research is possible. It’s also inconsistent.

NestCheck applies the same framework every time, so you can compare addresses on equal footing instead of relying on scattered map searches and guesswork.

This is not a listing platform. It’s decision support.

### CTA Copy (address input)
**Input placeholder options:**
- Search a U.S. address
- Enter address to evaluate

**Primary CTA button options:**
- Generate Report
- Analyze Address
- Get Livability Score

**Helper text under CTA:**
Built for renters and buyers making real decisions under time pressure.

### Footer Tagline
Location due diligence, made practical.

## 3) Evaluation Page Copy (framing around data)

## Option A — Warm + Guided

### Cold-landing Page Headline/Intro
**Headline:**
NestCheck Report for [Address]

**Intro:**

- **Notable proximity:** "This address is close to a known exposure source. Review the exact distance and context as part of your decision."
- **Clear radius:** "No major exposure sources were detected within this check radius based on available data."

### Share Prompt Copy
**Prompt:**
Comparing this place with someone else? Share this report so you can discuss the same facts — not just listing photos.

**Share CTA button options:**

- Copy Link to Report
