  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 13, 2025</p>

  <p>NestCheck (&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) operates the NestCheck website. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our service.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>Property Addresses</h3>
  <p>When you submit an address for evaluation, we collect that address and generate a neighborhood evaluation report. We do not associate addresses with personal identities. Evaluation reports are stored as snapshots accessible via unique URLs.</p>

  <h3>Payment Information</h3>
  <p>When you purchase an evaluation, payment is processed by Stripe, Inc. We do not store your credit card number, expiration date, or CVC on our servers. Stripe handles all payment data in accordance with PCI DSS standards. We receive only a transaction confirmation and the last four digits of your card for reference. For details on how Stripe handles your data, see <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe&rsquo;s privacy policy</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>
  <p>We set a single cookie, &ldquo;nc_vid,&rdquo; which is a randomly generated visitor identifier used to associate evaluation requests with your browser session. This cookie contains no personal information and is not used for advertising or cross-site tracking. You may disable cookies in your browser settings, though this may affect the functionality of the service.</p>
  <p>We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising cookies, or tracking pixels.</p>

  <h3>Usage Data</h3>
  <p>Our server logs may temporarily record IP addresses and request metadata for operational purposes such as error diagnosis and abuse prevention. These logs are not associated with individual identities and are not retained long-term.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

  <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Generate neighborhood evaluation reports for the addresses you submit</li>
    <li>Process payments for evaluation purchases</li>
    <li>Diagnose technical issues and prevent abuse of the service</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

  <p>To generate evaluation reports, we send the address you submit to the following third-party services:</p>

  <p><strong>Google Maps Platform</strong> &mdash; for geocoding, nearby places, walking and driving distances, and transit information. <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google&rsquo;s privacy policy</a></p>

  <p><strong>OpenStreetMap (Overpass API)</strong> &mdash; for road classification and green space data. <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenStreetMap&rsquo;s privacy policy</a></p>

  <p><strong>Walk Score API</strong> &mdash; for walkability, transit, and bike scores (when available). <a href="https://www.walkscore.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walk Score&rsquo;s privacy policy</a></p>

  <p>These services receive only the property address and geographic coordinates necessary to generate the report. No personal information is sent to these services.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>

  <p>Evaluation snapshots are retained for up to 12 months from the date of generation. Snapshots may be deleted after this period without notice.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>

  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. We share data only with the third-party services listed above, solely to generate your evaluation report, and with Stripe to process payments.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>

  <p>You may request deletion of a specific evaluation snapshot by contacting us at <a href="mailto:jab2493@columbia.edu">jab2493@columbia.edu</a>. Include the snapshot URL in your request.</p>

  <h2>Children&rsquo;s Privacy</h2>

  <p>NestCheck is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated &ldquo;Last updated&rdquo; date.</p>
