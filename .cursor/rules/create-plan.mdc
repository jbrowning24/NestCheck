# Plan Creation Phase

Based on our exploration, create a comprehensive implementation plan as a markdown file.

## Plan Requirements

### Structure
- Clear, minimal, actionable steps
- Each step is independently testable
- Steps ordered by dependency (what must come first)
- No unnecessary complexity beyond what we discussed

### Status Tracking
Use these emojis for each task:
- 🟩 **Done** - Completed and verified
- 🟨 **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- 🟥 **To Do** - Not started
- ⏸️ **Blocked** - Waiting on something

### Progress Indicator
Include dynamic overall progress at the top: `[===-------] 30%`

## Plan Template

Create a file named `PLAN-[feature-name].md`:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: [Feature Name]

**Progress:** `[----------] 0%`
**Created:** [Date]
**Status:** Planning Complete

---

## TL;DR
[2-3 sentences: What we're building, why, and the key technical approach]

## Critical Decisions
Architectural and implementation choices made during exploration:

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| [Area] | [What we chose] | [Why] |

## Dependencies & Prerequisites
- [ ] [Anything that must exist before we start]

---

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: [Foundation/Setup]
> [Brief description of this phase's goal]

- [ ] 🟥 **Task 1.1: [Name]**
  - [ ] 🟥 Subtask A
  - [ ] 🟥 Subtask B
  - **Files:** `path/to/file.ts`
  - **Acceptance:** [How we know it's done]

- [ ] 🟥 **Task 1.2: [Name]**
  - [ ] 🟥 Subtask A
  - **Files:** `path/to/file.ts`
  - **Acceptance:** [How we know it's done]

### Phase 2: [Core Implementation]
> [Brief description]

- [ ] 🟥 **Task 2.1: [Name]**
  ...

### Phase 3: [Integration & Polish]
> [Brief description]

- [ ] 🟥 **Task 3.1: [Name]**
  ...

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Unit tests for [component]
- [ ] Integration test for [flow]
- [ ] Manual QA: [specific scenarios]

## Rollback Plan
If something goes wrong:
1. [Step to revert]
2. [How to verify rollback worked]

## Notes
[Any additional context, links, or references]
```

## Rules

- **Still no code** - Just the plan
- **Be specific** - "Update user service" is bad; "Add `validateEmail()` to `UserService.ts`" is good
- **Include file paths** - Every task should reference specific files
- **Define done** - Each task needs clear acceptance criteria
- **Keep phases small** - 3-5 tasks per phase maximum
- **Order matters** - Dependencies should be obvious from the order

## Output

Save the plan to: `docs/plans/PLAN-[feature-name].md` (or project's preferred location)

Then say: "Plan created. Review it and let me know if any adjustments are needed before we execute."
