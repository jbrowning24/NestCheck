# Execute Plan

Time to implement. Follow the plan precisely and completely.

## Execution Requirements

### Code Quality
- Write elegant, minimal, modular code
- Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Include clear comments for complex logic
- No shortcuts that create tech debt

### Progress Tracking
As you complete each task:
1. Update the task status emoji (🟥 → 🟨 → 🟩)
2. Update the overall progress percentage
3. Note any deviations or discoveries

### Communication
After each phase or significant task:
- Summarize what was done
- List files changed
- Note any issues encountered
- Confirm ready to continue

## Execution Protocol

### Before Each Task
1. Re-read the task requirements
2. Identify the specific files to modify
3. Check for any blockers

### During Implementation
1. Make minimal, focused changes
2. Follow the plan—don't scope creep
3. If you discover something unexpected, STOP and report

### After Each Task
1. Verify the change works as expected
2. Update the plan file status
3. Brief summary: "Completed [task]. Changed [files]. [Any notes]."

## Status Report Format

After completing a phase:

```markdown
## Phase [N] Complete

### Tasks Completed
- ✅ Task X.1: [Brief description of what was done]
- ✅ Task X.2: [Brief description]

### Files Changed
- `path/to/file.ts` - [What changed]
- `path/to/other.ts` - [What changed]

### Discoveries/Deviations
- [Anything unexpected that came up]
- [Any minor adjustments made to the plan]

### Current Progress
`[====------] 40%`

### Ready for Phase [N+1]?
[Yes/No, and any blockers]
```

## Rules

- **Follow the plan** - Don't add features not in the plan
- **One task at a time** - Complete fully before moving on
- **Report deviations** - If you need to do something differently, explain why
- **Keep the plan updated** - It's the source of truth
- **Test as you go** - Don't wait until the end

## Edge Cases

**If you encounter a blocker:**
```
⚠️ BLOCKED: [Task name]
Reason: [What's blocking]
Options:
1. [Possible solution A]
2. [Possible solution B]
Recommendation: [Your suggestion]
```

**If you discover the plan needs adjustment:**
```
📝 PLAN ADJUSTMENT NEEDED
Current task: [Task name]
Issue: [What's wrong with the plan]
Proposed change: [What should change]
Impact: [What else this affects]
```

## Starting Execution

Say: "Ready to execute. Please confirm the plan file location, or I'll look for the most recent PLAN-*.md file."
