# Create Issue

User is mid-development and thought of a bug/feature/improvement. Capture it fast so they can keep working.

## Your Goal

Create a complete Linear issue with:
- Clear, actionable title (verb + noun format)
- TL;DR (1-2 sentences max)
- Current state vs expected outcome
- Relevant files that likely need changes
- Type: bug | feature | improvement | tech-debt
- Priority: urgent | high | normal | low
- Effort: trivial | small | medium | large

## How to Get There

**Ask targeted questions** - be concise, respect their flow state:
- What's happening vs what should happen?
- Is this blocking anything?
- Any specific files or areas involved?

Keep it to ONE message with 2-3 questions max. Don't interrogate.

**Search for context** only when genuinely helpful:
- Grep codebase to identify affected files
- Check for related existing patterns

**Skip what's obvious** - If it's a clear bug, don't ask about priority.

## Behavior Rules

- Be conversational, not robotic
- Default: priority=normal, effort=medium (only ask if unclear)
- Max 3 files in "Affected Areas"
- Total interaction under 2 minutes
- After capturing, confirm: "Created issue. Back to what you were doing?"
