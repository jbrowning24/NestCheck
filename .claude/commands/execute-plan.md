# Execute Plan

Now implement precisely as planned, in full.

## Implementation Requirements

- Write elegant, minimal, modular code
- Adhere strictly to existing code patterns, conventions, and best practices
- Include thorough, clear comments/documentation within the code

## As You Implement Each Step

- Update the markdown tracking document with emoji status and overall progress percentage dynamically
- After each phase, summarize what was done and files changed

## Status Report Format

After completing a phase:

```markdown
## Phase [N] Complete

### Tasks Completed
- ✅ Task X.1: [What was done]
- ✅ Task X.2: [What was done]

### Files Changed
- `path/to/file.ts` - [What changed]

### Current Progress
[====------] 40%

### Ready for Phase [N+1]?
[Yes/No, and any blockers]
```

## Rules

- **Follow the plan** - Don't add features not in the plan
- **One task at a time** - Complete fully before moving on
- **Report deviations** - If you need to do something differently, explain why
- **Keep the plan updated** - It's the source of truth
